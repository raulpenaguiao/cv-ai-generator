Regenerate with specific blurbs.
If it is good you should be able to modify the blurbs
Directly see the end result of the CV after clicking the button

For the MVP:
Is it a big deal to change all this to react?
Across different cycles I don't want to think about anything else
Just one CV template for now
Blurb management should have three buttons
	- Generate
	- Rephrase but keep structure and meaning and all that
	- Check grammar
Delete tab where we generate a CV
- A dark/light mode toggle using shadcn/ui’s theming system
Start with the most basebone display
Start with the most basebone API calls


Todo latter:
 - Just drop the link to get the job description
 - More templates
 - Add more functionalities on what to include in the blurbs from projects and jobs only latter
 - See the changes on the final product as we change the blurb


New architecture of the front end:
- Vite + React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS (configured via the Vite plugin — do NOT generate tailwind.config.js or postcss.config.js)
- shadcn/ui for accessible, themeable UI components
- TanStack Router (as the only routing solution — do NOT use react-router-dom)
- Biome as the linter and formatter (do NOT use ESLint or Prettier)
- Use only a single tsconfig.json (do NOT generate tsconfig.app.json or tsconfig.node.json)
- Do NOT include any Node-specific or server-side configuration
- No TanStack Query or external data fetching
- Deployment target is GitHub Pages (gh-pages branch)
- Set the correct base path in vite.config.ts for GitHub Pages

The site should include:
- A landing page (/) with name, short intro, and navigation
- Routing must be fully handled by TanStack Router
- A dark/light mode toggle using shadcn/ui’s theming system
- Tailwind and shadcn/ui components used for layout and content (e.g., Tabs, Card, Button)
- Biome must be configured via biome.json for formatting and linting
- Include predeploy and deploy npm scripts using gh-pages to publish the dist/ folder

Ensure all pages are reachable via clean routes and that the app runs locally with npm run dev.
